				<h1>Kingston Says "Yes to ADUs" in Effort to Raise Housing Stock</h1>

				<h6>Residents could start building with the city's contest-winning model this spring.</h6>

				<h5>By Jesse King; November 27, 2023</h5>

				<!-- Great ipsum texts: http://meettheipsums.com/ | this one is Sagan ipsum: http://saganipsum.com/ -->
				<p class="first-graph">The city of Kingston, New York has picked the winning design in a competition meant to make it easier for residents to build accessory dwellings units in their backyards. Brooklyn and Olivebridge-based DEMO Architecture was declared the winner over 25 other professional candidates in the "Yes to ADUs!" contest. A $25,000 prize will allow DEMO to develop permit-ready construction documents that Kingston residents can use to build a detached ADU -- sometimes called a guest cottage or in-law suite -- starting this spring.</p>

				<p>Mayor Steve Noble says he hopes to see 20 new backyard units a year to increase the city's housing stock. Like much of the Hudson Valley, Kingston is battling a housing crisis.</p>

				<p>"A decade ago, there was a housing study that said we should be building thousands of units of housing in Kingston and Ulster County by 2020 –- that didn’t happen," he explains. "So we here in the city of Kingston, feel that, over our next 10 years, we would like to build more than 1,000 new housing units."</p>

" /></noscript></div>

				<hr>

				<p style="padding-top:20px">Adam Bosch, CEO of Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, argues an increase in all types of housing will be needed to address the crisis head-on. Right now, he says there are a lot of families in apartments that, in easier times, would have been in their own homes. A recent report by Pattern examining data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that the average single worker in the Hudson Valley can no longer afford a one-bedroom apartment in any of the region’s nine counties. Median home prices are more than $100,000 higher than the mortgage a typical family would qualify for.</p>

				<p>"The bottom line is we need to do everything we can as civic leaders to entice, encourage, and allow the development of more housing in the Hudson Valley," Bosch explains. "Or the thing that we risk is people continuing to leave the region, people continuing to have fewer children, and our work force, volunteer pools, and neighborhoods shrinking over time."</p>
